# Introduction
Mindful is the mental health care website that provides services for people who need support with their mental health or want to understand more about their mental health well-being. This online service is free of charge, but customers can pay a premium to get additional and special treatment. Also, there is a donation system on the website that allows people to donate money for the benefit of the project and people with mental health illness.
